# Hi there, I'm George ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer and technical leader with 14 years of experience, passionate about building robust, scalable, and secure software solutions. My background is in engineering, but my focus is on leveraging technologyâ€”especially AI and data analysisâ€”to solve complex problems. I recently completed an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Bath to deepen my expertise.
